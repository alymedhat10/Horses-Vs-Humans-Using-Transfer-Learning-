# Horses-Vs-Humans-Using-Transfer-Learning-


I.	Project Overview:

This project uses Convolutional neural network to classify between Horses and Humans images using Transfer Learning. the Classification is binary and InceptionV3 is used as pretrained model. 
This project is part from Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow course by deeplearning.ai.


Note:

It would be preferred to run this code on colab.
